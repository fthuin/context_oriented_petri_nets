	\frametitle{Suggestion dependency relation}

	\textbf{Example} A system (on a phone) with 3 contexts:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Meeting context (M)
		\item Quiet context (Q)
		\item Noisy context (N)
	\end{itemize}

	When the user enters a meeting room, the Meeting context is activated.
	Meetings should be quiet, so incoming calls should be quiet. But this is
	not a strong constraint: meetings can become quite noisy.

	\begin{exampleblock}{Relation type}
		There is an exclusion dependency relation between Quiet and Noisy, and
		there is a \textit{suggestion dependency relation} between Meeting and Quiet,
		denoted \tikz{\scriptsize
		\node (A) {M}; \node[right of = A] (B) {Q}; \path[-open triangle 45, dashed] (A) edge node {} (B);
		}
	\end{exampleblock}
