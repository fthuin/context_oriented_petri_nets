	\textbf{Example} A system with 2 contexts:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Friends context (F)
		\item Connectivity context (C)
	\end{itemize}

	When the both contexts are activated, additional functionality is made
	available.

	\begin{exampleblock}{Relation type}
		This relation between the contexts is called a \textit{conjunction
		dependency relation}, denoted $\rightarrow$(F C).
